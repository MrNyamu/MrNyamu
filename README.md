Hi there 👋🏾

My name is Wesley Nyamu, A Software engineer based in Kenya. I focus on building financial products and learning to contribute to Bitcoin ⚡!

- 🔭 I'm working on [Minmo](https://minmo.to), A community-focused embeddable exchange for the on-ramp and off-ramp of Bitcoin.
- 🌱 I'm also contributing to [Bitsacco](https://bitsacco.com), A platform allowing sacco members to come together and save in Bitcoin.
- 💬 I've worked at [Fingo](https://fingo.africa), A neo-bank offering banking services to Kenyan youth.
- 🛠️ I recently built a web-based dashboard for managing your personal [Phoenix](https://phoenix.acinq.co/server) server. This is a simple, self‑custodial Bitcoin Lightning server you run yourself for managing your Bitcoin liquidity. Check it out [here](https://github.com/MrNyamu/phoenixd-dashboard).
- 🚧 I am currently building [Certivet](https://github.com/veluvo-softwares/Certivet), A Blockchain-Based System for Detecting Counterfeit Academic Certificates in Kenya, for my Bachelor's in Business Information Technology final year project.
- 📬 I'm looking to collaborate on Bitcoin as well as financial products
